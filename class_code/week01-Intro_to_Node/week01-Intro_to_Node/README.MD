This folder will contain some basic JS code. The goal here is to bring up some refreshers to JS and make sure you can run code on your IDE of choice and not just through your brower. 

How to run the code files one by one:

Open a terminal in your IDE
Navigate to the folder
to run code with node, we call node and then the filename

i.e:

I have a file called 'helloworld.js'
to run the file we can go to our terminal with the file ../helloworld.js

and run this in the terminal -> node helloworld.js
